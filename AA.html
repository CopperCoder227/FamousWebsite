                <p class="card-text">
                  One of the most iconic and recognizable paintings in the world is the Mona Lisa (ca. 1503-1519) painted by Leonardo da Vinci. The unique appeal of the portrait lies in its enigmatic nature, Mona Lisa’s smile radiates mystery, sensuality and contentment. This was achieved through sfumato, Leonardo’s painting technique that softened the transition between colors. This depth and complexity of expression is the reason the Mona Lisa is regarded as the pinnacle of portraiture. The interest in the portrait was further amplified by its mysterious history: the identity of the sitter, who commissioned the painting, how long Leonardo worked on the portrait and how it entered the French royal collection are all topics of scholarly debate.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Last Supper, one of the most famous artworks in the world, painted by Leonardo da Vinci probably between 1495 and 1498 for the Dominican monastery Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. It depicts the dramatic scene described in several closely connected moments in the Gospels, including Matthew 26:21–28, in which Jesus declares that one of the Apostles will betray him and later institutes the Eucharist. According to Leonardo’s belief that posture, gesture, and expression should manifest the “notions of the mind,” each one of the 12 disciples reacts in a manner that Leonardo considered fit for that man’s personality. The result is a complex study of varied human emotion, rendered in a deceptively simple composition.

                  In 1482, one of the most famous painters in world history, Leonardo da Vinci, took up residence at the court of Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan - as a musician  and inventor. Not long after, he became the official court painter, and was commissioned to paint a portrait of Ludovico’s 17-year-old mistress. This commission would engender one of the most fascinating portraits in Western European art, The Lady with an Ermine.

                  The innovative concepts embodied in Leonardo da Vinci’s designs, such as the da Vinci tank and the giant crossbow, set the stage for the future of warfare technology.

                  Although the technology of his time couldn’t bring these ideas to life, these innovative concepts remain a testament to da Vinci’s extraordinary imagination.
                  
                  This armored tank, an invention centuries ahead of its time, reflected Leonardo’s genius and his unique ability to observe, understand and manipulate the principles of nature and mechanical forces.                </p>

                  From an early age, the genius of Leonardo da Vinci shone brightly. An artist, inventor, scientist, and philosopher, he demonstrated a level of creativity and innovative thinking that was far ahead of his time. One particular field that captivated Leonardo’s imagination was flight. Leonardo da Vinci’s interest in flight sparked the conception of several extraordinary designs, including his notable creation – the Leonardo da Vinci’s helicopter.

                <p class="card-text">
                  The crossbow is also referred to as his Ballista. The machine was coiled or cocked using a worm gear (which he also designed), this enabled a huge mechanical advantage and allowed two men to fully draw back the huge bows of the crossbow.

Once cocked the machine could be fired by either hitting a release catch with a hammer or pulling on the catch with a rope, both mechanisms were designed by Leonardo for the firing of the crossbow. We would imagine the rope would have been preferred by anyone that may have operated such a huge weapon. Both of the release mechanisms can be seen to the left of the crossbow design above.
